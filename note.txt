In object detection, there are a few methods to do it:
1. sliding window object detection
2. R CNN
3. Fast R CNN
4. Faster R CNN
5. YOLO

say you have an image that contains a dog.
You ask: is this a dog or a person? 

Image classification->
Neural network output Dog=1, person=0.

Object Localization->
where exactly is the dog in this image? 
neural network output Dog=1, person=0 + Bounding box
how do we do that?
we have a vector that can look like this
[
    P_c -> probability dog or person? [0, 1]
    B_x -> bounding box's center x coordinate point
    B_y -> bounding box's center y coordinate point
    B_w -> bounding box's width
    B_h -> bounding box's height
    C_1 -> Dog class 1 or 0
    C_2 -> Person class 1 or 0
]
